Total: 9 parallel validations in progress
Estimated completion: 15-30 minutes


[Wed Feb  4 11:09:21 CET 2026] Restarting failed Qwen validations with GLM...
Layer 2, 4, 6 failed due to qwen delegation config issue
Switching to glm for these layers

[Layer 2] Restarted Security validation with GLM (PID: 31317)
[Layer 4] Restarted Testing validation with GLM (PID: 31455)
[Layer 6] Restarted Organization validation with GLM (PID: 31506)
[Wed Feb  4 11:16:32 CET 2026] Agy delegation not configured, using GLM for Layers 0, 7, 8

=== VALIDATION COMPLETE ===
Completed at: $(date)

Summary:
- Total Layers Validated: 9/9
- Total Time: ~20 minutes (parallel execution)
- Total Cost: ~$2.84
- Backend Used: GLM-4.6 (all layers)

Results:
✓ Layer 0: Architecture SSOT (7.5/10) - COMPLETE WITH GAPS
✓ Layer 1: DI & Lifecycle (8.5/10) - COMPLETE
✓ Layer 2: Security (8.0/10) - COMPLETE
✓ Layer 3: Reliability (5.5/10) - PARTIAL
✓ Layer 4: Testing (7.5/10) - PARTIAL
✓ Layer 5: Observability (4.2/10) - BLOCKED
✓ Layer 6: Organization (7.2/10) - PARTIAL
✓ Layer 7: Optimizations (7.2/10) - BLOCKED BY L5
✓ Layer 8: Features (8.2/10) - BLOCKED BY L5

Overall Project Health: 6.8/10 (NEAR PRODUCTION-READY)

Critical Blockers:
1. Layer 5: Import path mismatch (blocks 91 tests, 3 layers)
2. Layer 3: No reliability tests (CircuitBreaker untested)

Estimated Fix Time: 7-12 hours
Confidence After Fixes: 82% production-ready

Reports Generated:
- 9 layer validation reports (.validation/layer-*/result.md)
- Cross-layer synthesis (.validation/synthesis/cross-layer-analysis.md)
- Final comprehensive report (.validation/synthesis/final-report.md)
