# Beta Testing Guide 🧪

Welcome to the UnitAI Beta! We're excited to have you test our new unified AI agent system.

Since this is a "Beta" version, you might find bugs or things that don't work quite right. That's exactly why we need your help! Your feedback will directly shape the final product.

## How to Help

We use **GitHub Issues** to track everything. Think of an "Issue" as a ticket or a form where you tell us what's wrong or what you want to see.

### 🐛 Reporting a Bug (Something is broken)

If the system crashes, gives an error, or does something weird:

1.  Go to the **Issues** tab in this repository.
2.  Click the green **New Issue** button.
3.  Choose **Bug Report** (if available) or just start a blank issue.
4.  **Title**: Give it a short, clear name (e.g., *"Installation fails on Windows"* or *"Gemini backend timeout"*).
5.  **Description**:
    *   **What happened?** (Describe the error).
    *   **Steps to reproduce**: What were you doing right before it broke?
        *   *Example: "I ran `npx @jaggerxtrm/unitai` and then typed 'analyze this file'..."*
    *   **Screenshots/Logs**: If you can, paste the error message or a screenshot.

### 💡 Proposing a Change (I want a new feature)

If you think something could be better or want a new workflow added:

1.  Click **New Issue**.
2.  **Title**: Start with "Feature Request: [Your Idea]" (e.g., *"Feature Request: Add support for Claude 3 Opus"*).
3.  **Description**:
    *   **The Problem**: Why do you need this? What is currently difficult?
    *   **The Solution**: How should it work in your ideal world?

## Best Practices (Keep it Simple!)

*   **One thing per Issue**: If you found two different bugs, please make two separate reports. It helps us fix them faster!
*   **Be Specific**: Instead of saying "It doesn't work", tell us exactly *how* it failed (e.g., "It printed an error code 500").
*   **Check existing issues**: Before posting, take a quick look to see if someone else already reported it. If they did, you can just click the "thumbs up" 👍 reaction on their post to let us know you have the same problem.

Thank you for helping us build the future of AI agent orchestration! 🚀
