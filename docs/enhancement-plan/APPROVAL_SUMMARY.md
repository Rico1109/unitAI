# Enhancement Plan Approval Summary

**Date**: November 19, 2025
**Reviewer**: AI Assistant
**Review Scope**: All 4 enhancement task proposals

---

## Executive Summary

All four enhancement tasks have been reviewed with focus on ensuring the framework remains truly multi-purpose and language-agnostic. Three tasks are **fully approved**, and one task (OpenSpec integration) requires **conditional approval** with mandatory validation.

### Review Context

The unitai is a **multi-purpose framework** implemented in TypeScript/Bash (appropriate for MCP servers and Claude Code hooks) that serves projects in **various programming languages**. The critical review criterion was: **Will new features work equally well for Python, Go, Rust, and other language projects, or do they have hidden JavaScript/TypeScript bias?**

---

## Task 1: Hooks & Skills System Optimization

### Status: ✅ **APPROVED**

### Approval Rationale

**Why no concerns**: This task optimizes the framework's internal hooks and skills system. The implementation language (TypeScript/Bash) is appropriate for the MCP/Claude Code ecosystem and doesn't impact the target projects being worked on.

**Key points**:
- Hooks operate at the framework level, not project level
- Skill suggestions can be made language-aware if needed
- Internal optimizations don't affect multi-language support
- The framework itself being TS/JS is fine and expected

### Implementation Notes

No modifications required. The proposal is ready for implementation as written.

**Proposal Document**: `01-proposal-hooks-skills-optimization.md`

## Task 2: MCP Tools Integration (ask-cursor & droid)

### Status: ✅ **APPROVED**

### Approval Rationale

**Why approved**: The new tools (ask-cursor, droid) use general-purpose LLMs that handle multiple programming languages:
- **ask-cursor**: Uses GPT-5.1, Sonnet-4.5, Composer-1 (all multi-language)
- **droid**: Uses GLM-4.6 (supports multiple languages)

**Key points**:
- Tool wrappers written in TypeScript (appropriate for MCP)
- Underlying AI models are language-agnostic
- Deprecating ask-qwen/ask-rovodev is clean and justified
- Smart-workflows enhancement is sound

### Minor Consideration

During implementation, consider documenting:
- Which models work best for different languages
- Any language-specific performance differences
- Best practices for each language

This can be addressed during Phase B (documentation) of the implementation.

**Proposal Document**: `02-proposal-mcp-tools.md`

## Task 3: OpenSpec Integration

### Status: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

### Approval Rationale

**Why conditional**: OpenSpec uses markdown specifications (format is language-agnostic), but we must verify the **content** doesn't force JavaScript/TypeScript patterns onto other languages.

**Critical concern**: The proposal assumes OpenSpec works for all languages but provides no evidence.

### Mandatory Requirement: Phase 0 Validation

**BEFORE any integration work begins**, OpenSpec must be validated with:

1. **Python Project** (FastAPI/Django)
   - Test: "Add OAuth2 authentication endpoint"
   - Verify: No JS import patterns, natural Python idioms

2. **Go Project** (microservice/CLI)
   - Test: "Add gRPC health check endpoint"
   - Verify: No forced OOP patterns, works with Go's composition model

3. **Rust Project** (CLI/library)
   - Test: "Add JSON serialization with serde"
   - Verify: Handles ownership model, trait implementations

### Validation Test Methodology

#### Test 1: Spec Format Analysis
- Create specs for identical features in all 3 languages
- Compare: Do they force JS/TS patterns?
- Evaluate: Are they equally natural?

#### Test 2: Change Tracking
- Add dependencies (requirements.txt vs go.mod vs Cargo.toml)
- Create modules/packages/crates
- Verify delta format works for all language conventions

#### Test 3: AI Tool Compatibility
- Use specs with ask-cursor and droid
- Check: Do they generate appropriate code for each language?
- Measure: Code quality compared to direct prompting

### Decision Gates

| Outcome | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| ✅ **All tests pass** | Proceed to Phase 1 (Core Integration) |
| ⚠️ **Partial success** | Document limitations, create workarounds, proceed with caution |
| ❌ **Significant issues** | Postpone integration, consider alternatives |

### Updated Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 0**: Language Validation (Week 1) - **MANDATORY**
- **Phase 1**: Core Integration (Week 2-3) - Only if Phase 0 approved
- **Phase 2**: Workflow Enhancement (Week 4-5)
- **Phase 3**: Production Deployment (Week 6)

**Total Effort**: 6-8 weeks (up from original 4-6 weeks)

### Updated Proposal

The OpenSpec integration proposal has been **updated** with:
- Conditional approval status at the top
- Comprehensive Phase 0 validation section
- Detailed test requirements for Python, Go, Rust
- Decision gates and success criteria
- Updated timeline and risk assessment

**Proposal Document**: `openspec-integration-proposal.md` (updated to v2.0)

## Task 4: Custom Slash Commands

### Status: ✅ **APPROVED**

### Approval Rationale

**Why approved**: The slash commands are conceptually language-agnostic and provide useful shortcuts for repetitive workflows.

**Key points**:
- `/init-session`: Framework-level initialization
- `/save-commit`: Can detect project type for validation
- `/ai-task`: Delegates to language-agnostic workflows
- `/create-spec`: Can use language-specific templates
- `/check-docs`: Already language-agnostic (context7, deepwiki)

### Minor Implementation Notes

**`/save-commit` validation** should detect project type:

```typescript
async function validateProject(projectRoot: string) {
  const projectType = await detectProjectType(projectRoot);
  
  switch(projectType) {
    case 'python':
      await run('pytest');
      await run('ruff check');
      break;
    case 'go':
      await run('go test ./...');
      await run('golangci-lint run');
      break;
    case 'rust':
      await run('cargo test');
      await run('cargo clippy');
      break;
    case 'typescript':
      await run('npm test');
      await run('npm run lint');
      break;
  }
}
```

This is straightforward to implement and doesn't require proposal changes.

## Implementation Priority & Order

### Recommended Order

1. **Task 2** (MCP Tools) - Week 1-3
   - Provides enhanced tools for all subsequent work
   - No blockers

2. **Task 1** (Hooks & Skills) - Week 4-5
   - Can leverage new MCP tools
   - Optimizes framework guidance

3. **Task 3 Phase 0** (OpenSpec Validation) - Week 6
   - **STOP POINT**: Review results before proceeding
   - Decision: Proceed, modify, or postpone

4. **Task 4** (Slash Commands) - Week 7-8 (or parallel with Task 3)
   - Depends on Task 2 workflows
   - Can run parallel to OpenSpec validation

5. **Task 3 Phase 1-3** (OpenSpec Integration) - Week 9-14
   - Only if Phase 0 approved
   - Final integration phase

### Total Timeline

- **Without OpenSpec issues**: 12-14 weeks
- **With OpenSpec workarounds**: 14-16 weeks
- **If OpenSpec postponed**: 8-9 weeks (Tasks 1, 2, 4 only)

## Risk Summary

| Task | Risk Level | Key Risk |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Task 1 | Low | Framework-internal changes |
| Task 2 | Low | LLMs are multi-language |
| Task 3 | Medium | Unknown language bias |
| Task 4 | Low | Simple command wrappers |

### Overall Risk Assessment

**Low-Medium Risk** with Task 3 being the primary uncertainty. The mandatory Phase 0 validation significantly reduces risk by catching issues early.

3. **Update project documentation** with language-agnostic requirements
4. **Begin Task 2 implementation** as first priority

### Before Starting Each Task

- [ ] Confirm language-agnostic requirements understood
- [ ] Plan testing across multiple languages
- [ ] Document language-specific considerations

### Task 3 Specific Actions

- [ ] Set up test Python project
- [ ] Set up test Go project

---

## Conclusion

The enhancement plan is **comprehensive and well-researched**. With the addition of Phase 0 validation for OpenSpec, all tasks are ready for implementation.

**Key Insight**: The framework being implemented in TypeScript/Bash is appropriate and not a concern. The critical requirement is ensuring new features (especially OpenSpec) don't force JavaScript/TypeScript patterns onto projects in other languages.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation in the recommended order, with special attention to Task 3's Phase 0 validation as a mandatory gate.

**Approval Summary**:
- Task 1: ✅ Approved
- Task 2: ✅ Approved
- Task 3: ⚠️ Conditionally Approved (Phase 0 required)
- Task 4: ✅ Approved
