# Task 1: Hooks & Skills System Optimization

## Objective
Optimize the Claude Code hooks and skills system to be less restrictive while maintaining guidance effectiveness. The system should guide Claude toward efficient tool usage without blocking execution.

## Status
- [x] Documentation review completed
- [x] Current system analysis completed
- [x] Proposal created
- [x] Implementation plan approved
- [x] Changes implemented
- [x] Testing completed

## Required Documentation Review
**You MUST read and understand these resources before proposing any changes:**

### Primary Documentation
- [Claude Code Hooks Guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) - Official hook system documentation
- [Claude Code Skills Guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) - Official skills documentation

### Reference Examples
- [Agent Skills Refactoring Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1opxgq4/i_was_wrong_about_agent_skills_and_how_i_refactor/)
- [DevOps Skills Example](https://github.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/tree/main/.claude/skills/devops)
- [Infrastructure Showcase](https://github.com/diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase)
- [6 Months Tips Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1oivjvm/claude_code_is_a_beast_tips_from_6_months_of/)

## Current State
- `.claude/hooks/smart-tool-enforcer.sh` - Recently converted from blocking to warning
- `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json` - Contains 7 skills with "suggest" enforcement
- Hook types in use: `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`

## Requirements

### Hook System
1. **Less Restrictive Approach**: Find sweet-spot between guidance and freedom
2. **Educational Messages**: Inform without blocking
3. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Recommend tools based on context

### Tool Usage Guidance
The system should guide Claude to use:
- **serena**: For code retrieval without reading entire files (avoid 1000+ LOC reads)
- **claude-context**: For semantic search as first approach to understand context and file relationships
- **unitAI tools**: For complex agentic tasks (details in Task 2)
- **Memory systems**: openmemory, openmemory-cloud, serena memories

## Instructions for Implementation

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
1. Read ALL documentation links above
2. Analyze current `.claude/skills/` directory structure
3. Review current `.claude/hooks/` implementations
4. Study the reference examples for best practices

### Phase 2: Proposal Creation
**DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET. Create a proposal document that includes:**
1. Summary of findings from documentation review
2. Analysis of current system strengths/weaknesses
3. Specific recommendations for:
   - Skill definitions improvements
   - Hook timing and triggers
   - Message content and tone
   - New skills to add (if any)
4. Migration plan (if breaking changes needed)

### Phase 3: Update This Task
After creating your proposal:
1. Check off "Documentation review completed" ✅
2. Check off "Current system analysis completed" ✅
3. Check off "Proposal created" ✅
4. Link your proposal document here: [Proposta di Ottimizzazione](file://01-proposal-hooks-skills-optimization.md)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Hooks provide guidance without frustration
- [x] Skills activate at appropriate times
- [x] Documentation is clear and actionable
- [x] System guides toward token-efficient patterns
- [x] No legitimate workflows are blocked

## Implementation Completed

**Data**: 2025-11-19  
**Summary**: [Implementation Summary](file://IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md)

Tutte le 4 fasi completate con successo:
- Fase 1: Quick Wins ✅
- Fase 2: Core Improvements ✅
- Fase 3: Advanced Features ✅
- Fase 4: New Skills ✅

Sistema pronto per uso in produzione.

## Notes
- Balance is key: too restrictive frustrates users, too permissive wastes tokens
- Consider different skill priorities (critical, high, medium, low)
- Remember hooks can access full tool input context
