# Feature Design

Orchestrates a multi-agent team to design, implement, and test a feature.

This workflow activates three specialized agents:
1. **ArchitectAgent:** Designs the solution structure.
2. **ImplementerAgent:** Writes the code.
3. **TesterAgent:** Generates test suites.

## Usage
Use for complex features requiring multiple files or careful architectural planning.
