# Refactor Sprint

Coordinates a multi-agent team to plan and execute a complex refactor.

This workflow:
1. **Cursor Agent:** Generates a detailed refactoring plan and patches.
2. **Gemini:** Reviews the plan for architectural risks.
3. **Droid:** Creates an operational checklist for execution.

## Usage
Use for significant code restructuring, technical debt reduction, or pattern migration.
