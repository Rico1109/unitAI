# Validate Last Commit

Analyze a specific git commit for quality, security, and breaking changes.

This workflow examines the *committed* code (unlike pre-commit which checks staged files). It retrieves the commit metadata, diff, and file list, then runs parallel analysis using Gemini and Cursor.

## Key Checks
- **Breaking Changes:** API compatibility.
- **Security:** Leaked secrets or vulnerabilities.
- **Best Practices:** Code style and patterns.

## Usage
Use this in CI pipelines or for post-commit reviews. Defaults to HEAD (most recent commit).
