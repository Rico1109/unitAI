# Bug Hunt

Orchestrates a multi-agent investigation to find and analyze bugs based on symptoms.

This workflow:
1. **Searches** the codebase for relevant files based on symptoms (if not provided).
2. **Analyzes** files in parallel using Gemini (Root Cause) and Cursor (Hypothesis).
3. **Plans** a fix using Droid (Remediation Plan).
4. **Checks** related files for impact.

## Usage
Use when you have a bug report or error message but don't know exactly where the issue lies.
